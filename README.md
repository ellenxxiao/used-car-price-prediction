# used-car-price-prediction

I am playing with Machine Learning models to predict the used car price.

The project has five section:
1) Clean dataset
2) EDA
3) Prepare data for models
4) Building Models (Linear Regression and RandomForest Regression)
5) Conclusions.

Please feel free to go to the Jupyterbook and take a look:)
